# Do We Live in a Simulation?

# Introduction

---

**What is the nature of the universe? Of everything around us? Of life itself?** According to modern science, the universe was created by the big bang. However, this does not answer the question; rather, it creates even more. Simulation theory answers this question from the perspective of a computer scientist rather than a physicist.

Simulation theory proposes that reality itself - the earth, the universe, and all of us - is an artificial simulation. This theory's basis is the Church-Turing thesis: any real-world computation can be translated into an equivalent computation by a Turing machine. What this means is that a Turing machine can simulate any physical process. Therefore, it is not impossible that our universe itself can be a simulation, running on a powerful computer of so-called "higher beings". We may not be able to prove that this hypothesis to be true, but at the same time, we cannot conclusively prove its falseness. Hence this possibility cannot be ruled out.

# A simple example

---

**Consider the classic platform game, Super Mario Bros.** Consider also, that Mario (and Luigi too, if anyone remembers him) is an intelligent being. From Mario's perspective, his universe is the game itself. All physical laws, objects, and Mario himself are simulated. He has no way of knowing that he is, in fact, part of a video game programmed by superior beings (in this case, us humans). He lives his whole life, thinking that Super Mario Land is the only world there is. Another point to consider is that as players of the game, we can pause it whenever we want, without it being physically detectable inside the game. There are, however, ways that Mario can begin to suspect that his world is a simulation. For example, bugs in the code that lead to unexpected scenarios in the game, triggered by certain actions. This means that it is possible to take actions from within the simulation, which affects it and breaks down its laws. 

What this example tells us is that games are as hard as real life itself, since, from the point of view of those inside the game, it is nothing but real life.

Extending this example, we are like Mario. We attempt to explain our universe through math and physics - through our own intelligence. We may not be able to imagine a computer so powerful as to simulate everything we see around us, but neither can we imagine the intelligence and intentions of those running the simulation. It could be impossible to detect the simulation unless we find ways to exploit it. There are scenarios where our explanations break down, such as our inability to unify quantum physics and gravity. Finding actions which break the universe, can serve as unofficial proof that we can exploit the simulation from inside it and break its rules.

# Recursive simulations

---

A logical extension of this theory has to do with explaining the universe of those controlling the simulation. If we can simulate a game, and our universe itself is a simulation, then it is also possible that the computer which runs our simulation is itself in a simulated universe, and so on. Each level of the recursion tree could have multiple universes side by side. This is best left to the imagination.

# Conclusion

---

In our project, we have proved that a platformer, such as Celeste, with no random elements in its code, is NP-complete. We conclude with this: If games can be as hard as real-life problems, then can real life too, be a computer simulation?
