This repo contains parts of a research our work on understanding Complexity Theory and its applications. We are focusing on complexity classes of real-life problems that are mathematically modeled. We plan on analyzing real-world problems starting with a game, and modeling it mathematically, and then classify it under a complexity class.

Further, we talk about modelling games and complexity classes related to different formalizatons of games. We also briefly talk about the design principles of platformers or 2D puzzle-based video games.
