This repo contains parts of our work on understanding Complexity Theory and its applications. We planned on analyzing problems based on decision making in platformer games, and modeling it mathematically, and then classify it under a complexity class.

Further, we talk about modelling games and complexity classes related to different formalizatons of games. We also briefly talk about the design principles of platformers or 2D puzzle-based video games.
